## Dr. Paul Attie

Paul Attie is a Professor of Computer Science at Augusta University. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin in 1995.

Paul's research is in software engineering, formal methods, and distributed computing. He is currently interested in methods for the effective documentation and analysis of code.  He also works on devising efficient methods for specifying, designing, and reasoning about the behavior of large distributed and concurrent software systems. In particular, he showed that the safety, liveness, and deadlock-freedom of large concurrent programs can be established by reasoning about small sets (2 or 3) of component processes at a time, thereby avoiding state-explosion.

Paul has previously held faculty positions at Florida International University, Northeastern University, and the American University of Beirut.  He was also a Visiting Scientist and Research Affiliate at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
